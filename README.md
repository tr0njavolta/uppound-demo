# UpPound Application 

The UpPound app is a demo application meant to aid new users in their Upbound
journey.

The application consists of three parts:

1. A UI frontend built with React
2. A server built with Node.js
3. A postgresql database for data population

Work in progress on getting these components broken into an Upbound project, but
the end state looks like this:
